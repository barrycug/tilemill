This crash course will walk you through downloading data and using TileMill. For anyone who is new to mapping, this guide will walk you step-by-step through TileMill and will link you to the reference documentation along the way so you can learn the power in custom map making. For anyone coming from a GIS or cartography background, this guide will help you quickly dive into the core functions of TileMill. 

[Begin here](/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/tilemill-gis) for a brief overview of TileMill technology and what it means for creating maps. If you have any questions along the way, [start a discussion with our support team](http://support.mapbox.com).

## What we'll cover

**[Importing data](/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/point-data)**  
  Here we will show you how to download a common type of data that is supported by TileMill. If you want a more in-depth overview of adding layers in our technical reference first, see [here](/tilemill/docs/manual/adding-layers).

**[Styling data](/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/styling)**  
  We will show the step-by-step basics of changing default styles and making a truly custom map. We use a CSS-like language called Carto to style your data. If you want a in-depth overview of Carto, check out our [technical reference](/tilemill/docs/manual/carto).

**[Adding tooltips and legends](/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/tooltips)**  
  Making your map interactive or adding a legend is critical to communicating your data. Here we will show you how to add tooltip interactivity and help you explain your map with a legend. For an in-depth overview, check out the [technical reference on project settings](/tilemill/docs/manual/project-settings).

**[Exporting your map](/tilemill/docs/manual/exporting)**  
  A designed map can be shared quickly and easily in a number of formats. Here we'll show you how to export to the MBTiles format for uploading on the web. For an in-depth overview of all supported formats, see [here](/tilemill/docs/manual/exporting) in our technical reference.
